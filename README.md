# MineKey
##A very silly project to build a "better" keyboard for Modded Minecraft.

Prerequisites: 
You'll need to include the following libraries. They're availabe from the Arduino Library manager
https://github.com/lostcaggy/rotary_caggy
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306
Use the Earlphilhower Raspberry Pi Pico board definition https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico

Some thanks - Brendan and Michael for putting up with my stupid comments and fumblling.

lostcaggy - This person deserves kudos! This is the first and only library I have found to handle rotary encoders on the Raspberry Pi Pico properly.
Earlphilhowe - Your work allowed me to actually finish this project!
Revised schematic with better pin mappings and a spot for a 128x64 OLED rather than the 128x32 I used in the original proto board.
